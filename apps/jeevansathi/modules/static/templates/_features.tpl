<h2>B. Further customise your confidentiality levels</h2>
</div>
<p class="content"> At Jeevansathi.com we understand that different people have different needs for privacy and confidentiality. Thus For this reason we empower our registrants with tools to customize the privacy levels of their profile, photographs and contacts.<br> <br> <span class="b">Some of these settings are :</span><br> <span class="b">For Profile</span> </p>
<ul class="terms">
<li>Allow my detailed profile to be viewed by all visitors or</li>
<li>Allow my detailed profile to be viewed only by registered users who pass my filters.</li>
<li>Don't show my detailed profile or summary profile to any user, I will search and contact profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content"> Profile visibility settings are available in the settings section which is accessible from the header and footer on all pages after login. We recommend that you go in for the first privacy setting as that will get you the maximum response. Frequently our site is searched by casual browsers who are highly qualified, eligible people or friends and relatives of a prospective bride or groom and thus your profile is visible to this important group of visitors. </p>
<p class="content"> Of course if you wish to maintain a higher level of privacy and confidentiality then you can go in for the second option. And if you want the maximum level of privacy then you can select the third option. </p>
<p class="content"> Please note that in the first two profile visibility options, your summary profile will be viewed by all visitors. It will show your username, age, height, caste, occupation, city and date of updation. Typically these are the details by which you cannot be identified. In the second case, an unregistered user will be prompted to register and it will be checked if they pass your filters and only then would they be able to view your detailed profile. Whereas in the third case nobody will be able to view your summary or detailed profile. </p>
<p class="content"> However, we would recommend you to go for the second option because the third option might minimize the number of responses your profile can get. </p>
<p class="content"> <span class="b">For Photograph</span><br> In case you wish to upload your photograph(s) along with your profile then you have the following options :
</p><ul class="terms">
<li>I want my photos to be visible to all members.</li>
<li>I want my photos to be visible only to members I contact and to members I accept.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="content"> Thus you get to set that privacy level for your photograph which you feel most comfortable with. </p>
<p class="content"> We would however recommend that you do upload your photographs and go in for the first privacy setting option as that is likely to get you the maximum relevant response. The photograph privacy settings options are available in the 'My Photos' section of the 'My Profile' page. This page can be accessed after you have registered your profile. </p>
