<p class="content">We help our users discover the best matches but it is in the interests of a user to use their best judgment to assess another person&#146;s genuineness and interest in marriage.</p>
We strongly recommend all our members to beware of the following:</p>
<p class="content">1. If some members seems to have entered false, incorrect information about their education, profession, income, family etc.</p>
