We wish you great success in this online service. ..." All says matches are made in heaven, I still believe in this. It's only that jeevansathi.com helped as a very good catalyst messenger in the process. I always dreamt that boy who has a reasonable matching height not and very much age difference, good features and professional qualified working as a professional last and most importantly, I was seriously interested that boy should work outside the India. One Day, I am searching out the profile for a suitable match for me and I came across the one profile which likes and feels that this can be my dream person, his profile is according to my wish and I like to read it, I forwarded the same to my brother he stays in Dubai and the boy was also staying in Dubai. He wrote him a mail " please go through my sister's profile and if its suits you then reply me back with more detail about you and family members". Very soon he replied to my brother along-with his details the mail shows that he is very keen to meet with my brother, then they meet personally in Dubai. We both are almost ready to get marry with each other, even we had not seen each other by face to face, but our feelings for each other is very strong, then 4th July he came to India (Udaipur) and on 8th of July he reached Delhi along with his maternal Uncle they visited our house. Both of us liked each other we had a long talk and finally his maternal uncle said that" ok hum abhi ladki ko shagun dena chahate hai ", but my mom says we will discuss with our" GURU JI "and with our relatives and then we will let you know. Immediately both of us rushed to Guru Ji place and blessed by them. In the evening (8th of July,2004 we got engaged and after one month that is in the August on 18th ,2004 we got married and 19th August we left for Honeymoon for Bangkok and finally I reached my dream world Dubai on 29th of August 2004. I am very lucky to have such a wonderful husband in life, who is so caring, so loving , so understanding. If there is some award for the husband I would definitely give his name on the first no. really he is a gem of person life without him is not possible. Apart from that my mother-in-law is more than my mother she is amazing. My all in-laws are very nice thank God.

			<p>Thanks to Jeevansaathi. U have indeed done a great job in uniting me and my hubby Kaushik.It was he who first approached me in May,2004.Before also he approached me but as he was not a paid member we couldnot communicate..yes its really needed to be a paid member for a serious search. This time he approached me straightway through an initial mail giving his chat id .The communication started.He took my phone nos and for 9 to 10 months there were regular chatting and phone calls and gradually we realised that we have got our dream partners. Then there was a parental talk and after eight months courtship we got united by the grace of God on this 27th of January ,2005 in Delhi though I was from a remote place of Assam and its obvious if Jeevan saathi wouldnt have given us the opportunity this miraculous happy ending wouldnt have been possible. We thank frm the core of our heart to jeevansaathi .Its really thank worthy and wish all other members that they get their dream partners frm this site soon. Arundhoti Banerjee</p>
