    	 <h1>Cancer and Matrimony</h1>
         <p>Cancer may be a life threatening ailment. But, with advances in medicine, it is now hardly life stopping! In fact, post treatment; many consider life to be a brand new beginning with a fresh perspective on life and understanding the true and deeper implications of love, care and companionship. Post surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, many survivors have been leading full, active and fulfilling lives. Some have been afflicted by cancer after marriage and have lead a meaningful and satisfying married life. And, therefore, those who are young and un-married need not consider cancer as an impediment to their marriage prospects or enjoying a satisfying love life. Even those operated with ovarian or cancers live happy and satisfying married lives. </p>
         <p> 

However, we strongly recommend all cancer survivors to first speak to their doctor, particularly the oncologist before considering matrimony. Generally, doctors recommend patients to wait for at least 5 years after treatment. It's called the remission period and after which chances of recurrence are minimal.  Following are a few real life stories of people who have survived cancer, got married, had children and are REAL LIFE HEROES. We call them 'Victors', for they epitomize the human spirit of resilience and the triumph of the spirit to overcome all odds and life a Full and Fruitful married life. </p>

            	<p><img src="~sfConfig::get('app_img_url')`/seo_pg_img/quote-start.jpg" style="margin-left:-22px" /> In 1999 I came to know that I have breast cancer after a biopsy of a lump in my breast was done.I was studying for my  college exams. My parents hid it from me.We went to Chennai to meet the doctor.I was told that I have to have Chemotherapy. Coincidentally my chemotherapy started on Holi, a day of colours. Being in a hospital on Holi!!!Really horrible.
 </p>
<p>I kept thinking of my illness. In a way I was happy that there were no responsibilities on me.I really felt very sorry for my parents who were really in a state of shock.Dr. Chadrasekharn from benaras along with her team gave me all type of support and my treatment took six months.As the treatment did not work my cancer advanced .I was naturally disappointed.
 </p><p>
Finally the treatment finished and I went back home.
 </p><p>
I completed my graduation, post graduation and teachers training course. Then I joined my father in his buisness.
One of my friend put my profile on the website..I got a proposal from a boy who had had CML and done Bone Marrow transplant.We met and consulted the doctor. He gave us the go ahead for marriage and later he said we could have a baby.
       </p><p>
Today I am happy with my family and have almost forgotton my illness.I do not let Cancer bother me.I am so grateful to the doctors and all those around me who gave me the emotional and mental strength.I want to thank everyone for all that they have done for me.<img src="~sfConfig::get('app_img_url')`/seo_pg_img/quote-end.jpg" style="position:relative; top:8px; left:5px" /></p>

            <p><img src="~sfConfig::get('app_img_url')`/seo_pg_img/quote-start.jpg" style="margin-left:-22px; " />A pain in my stomach made me go to the doctor. He advised me blood test.I came to know that I have CML.I felt as if I have been delivered a death sentence. .Will I live or will I die? The date was uncertain. </p><p>
 
I first went to a hospital in Delhi but I was not satisfied. So I came to Mumbai. All tests were done at Tata Memorial hospital and I was told that I could have Bone Marrow transplant done. Fortunately my brother could be my donor. It was a painful process and very troublesome. I was really troubled but fortunately all my troubles came to an end and soon after treatment I joined office.
 </p><p>
My family was a big pillar of support. I wanted to get married but who would marry me? I went to a website and found the profile of a girl who had breast cancer.We met, discussed and after understanding all the things from a doctor we got married. In 2009 we were blessed with a little Baby Girl.We are really happy with Nandini.As a matter of precaution I have got her Cord Blood preserved.May she Never need it!!!!
 </p><p>
We are very happy with each other and never want to look back. The support from the doctors and family was really great and helped me to move forward. I am specalliy grateful to Dr. Saikia for all his encouragement and treatment.<img src="~sfConfig::get('app_img_url')`/seo_pg_img/quote-end.jpg" style="position:relative; top:8px; left:5px" /> </p>
