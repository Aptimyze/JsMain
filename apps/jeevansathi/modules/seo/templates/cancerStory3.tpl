    	 <h1>Cancer and Matrimony</h1>
         <p>Cancer may be a life threatening ailment. But, with advances in medicine, it is now hardly life stopping! In fact, post treatment; many consider life to be a brand new beginning with a fresh perspective on life and understanding the true and deeper implications of love, care and companionship. Post surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, many survivors have been leading full, active and fulfilling lives. Some have been afflicted by cancer after marriage and have lead a meaningful and satisfying married life. And, therefore, those who are young and un-married need not consider cancer as an impediment to their marriage prospects or enjoying a satisfying love life. Even those operated with ovarian or cancers live happy and satisfying married lives. </p>
         <p> 

However, we strongly recommend all cancer survivors to first speak to their doctor, particularly the oncologist before considering matrimony. Generally, doctors recommend patients to wait for at least 5 years after treatment. It's called the remission period and after which chances of recurrence are minimal.  Following are a few real life stories of people who have survived cancer, got married, had children and are REAL LIFE HEROES. We call them 'Victors', for they epitomize the human spirit of resilience and the triumph of the spirit to overcome all odds and life a Full and Fruitful married life. </p>

            	<p><img src="~sfConfig::get('app_img_url')`/seo_pg_img/quote-start.jpg" style="margin-left:-22px" /> I am a Sales and Marketing professional working with a MNC Consulting and Outsourcing company. Having been brought up in an Army family, I spent my childhood across multiple schools and cities. Post my schooling, I graduated as an Engineer and then completed my MBA in Marketing. I have been working in private sector for over 12 years and have worked in various cities across the country.
 </p><p>
It was during my first job at Chennai that I had Typhoid (Feb'99), which had me bed-ridden for a week. While I resumed work post this, but the weakness caused due to this illness did not go away even after several months. I had started getting weaker, lost weight and used to feel feverish for few hours in the morning. After this continued for about seven months, I decided to go for a whole body check-up at Apollo Hospital in Chennai. It was during this check-up that it was diagnosed that I probably had CML and was advised to get a bone marrow test done to confirm the same. I immediately rushed to Delhi and got the bone marrow test done at AIIMS, which confirmed the diagnosis to CML. This was in Sep'99. 
  </p><p>
It did take some days to digest the enormity of the disease, but I resolved to get over it and get back to my normal life. The doctors initially mentioned that I will not be able to work for few years, which was quite depressing, but it also helped me get stronger in my resolve to get my life back. I got myself transferred to Delhi and resumed work while I was on medication. During this time, my parents and two brothers got together and we got the tests conducted for HLA matching. Fortunately I had a match with my elder brother, which was a key milestone in the whole treatment. We then started evaluating the options available for getting the BMT done, which was primarily based on overall costs and credibility of the hospitals & doctors. During this process we also spoke to several people who had undergone treatment for cancer and they suggested Tata Memorial Hospital as the best for my treatment. 
  </p><p>
I then visited TMH and met Dr. Advani who then guided me to Dr. Saikia with whom we finalized the dates for BMT besides bombarding him with all kinds of questions and apprehensions. He also made us meet the resident doctors at TMH and visit the BMT facility. The BMT was scheduled for third week of December and I was asked to report to the TMH by first week for the initial tests. The company I worked in granted me six month's leave for the treatment. I was admitted to TMH on 10th Dec and after few days of chemotherapy was given the stem cells on 23rd Dec 1999. I welcomed the new millennium from the BMT ward in TMH while fighting the various ailments associated with GVHD. I must admit that the resident doctors and the nursing staff really took great care of me and also doubled up as my friends to cheer me up during the entire treatment. 
  </p><p>
I was discharged from TMH in mid-Jan'00, but was asked to stay in Mumbai itself for my follow-ups for another six months. However, we had to ensure a lot of precautions about my place of stay. Thus, started another round of struggle for my parents to find such a place and for such a long duration. Finally we managed to get a place in the Army cantonment at Colaba, which was a bit far from TMH. I used to report to TMH every week for my follow-ups and this continued till May'00. In between I had to get admitted to TMH twice again due to some complications. 
  </p><p>
I was given the permission to rejoin work in May'00 by Dr. Saikia and I still remember the elation that I felt on hearing those sweet words. After working in my Mumbai office for a month, I was allowed to move back to Delhi. The doctors at Army's R&R hospital agreed to my visiting them for the follow-ups, which had become a monthly process by then. Thus started my journey of getting back my life to normal…….I have been married for over six years now and also have a two year old son. 
  </p><p>
In hindsight, I feel privileged to have undergone this experience which gave me an entirely new perspective about life and its challenges. I have seen my family go through a lot of troubles in supporting my treatment, be it financially or the running around in the hospitals. Therefore I attribute my successful recovery to my family without whom it would have been impossible to get back my life. And not to forget the contribution of the Doctors and staff at TMH who keep chugging along in the background towards saving one life after another.
