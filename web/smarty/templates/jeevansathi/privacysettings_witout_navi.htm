				<!--DISCRIPTION STARTS-->
				At Jeevansathi we believe that protecting the confidentiality and privacy of our registered users is very important. For this reason , our basic features are designed to protect your confidentialty. Further we have sophisticated tools that enable you to set your privacy and confidentiality levels to those that you are comfortable with.
<br><br>
				<div class="bgg1 pad2"><b>A. Universal Confidentiality features </b></div>
				<br><br>
				<b>Profile design</b><br>
				Our profile format is designed so as to prevent people from identifying you unless you wish them to do so. Thus the information that is gathered is general in nature - age, height, gender, caste, ethnicity, occupation, location, family profile, interests, desired partner profile etc. Typically information that will help generate interest among the right prospective life partners without individually identifying you. Uploading photographs is optional. 
<br><br>
<b>Contact information</b><br>
&#8226; You cannot be contacted by anyone who has not registered with us.<br>
&#8226; Your contact information is never revealed to a casual surfer whether he has registered with us or not.<br>
&#8226; It is also not revealed to the people you contact unless he or she accepts your contact and is a paid member. Or if you are a paid member and have actively opted for your contact information to be sent with your contact.<br>
&#8226; In case someone contacts you and you accept then the person who contacted you will get to know your contact details only if you accept the contact and he is a paid member, or if you are a paid member and you opt to send him your contact information.

<br><br>

 
<div class="bgg1 pad2"><b>B. Further customise your confidentiality levels </b></div><br>
At Jeevansathi we understand that different people have different needs for privacy and confidentiality. Thus For this reason we empower our registrants with tools to customize the privacy levels of their profile, photographs and contacts. 
<br><br>
<b>Some of these settings are :</b>
<br><br>
<b>For Profile</b><br>
&#8226; Allow my detailed profile to be viewed by all visitors or<br>
&#8226; Allow my detailed profile to be viewed only by those registered members whose profiles pass my Filter settings. <br>
&#8226; Hide my detailed profile as well as its summary from all users
<br><br>
Profile privacy settings are available on the first page of the profile registration form. We recommend that you go in for the first privacy setting as that will get you the maximum response. Frequently our site is searched by casual browsers who are highly qualified, eligible people or friends and relatives of a prospective bride or groom and thus your profile is visible to this important group of visitors. 
<br><br>
Of course if you wish to maintain a higher level of privacy and confidentiality then you can go in for the second option. And if you want the maximum level of privacy then you can select the third option. 
<br><br>
Please note that in these three privacy setting options, your summary profile will be viewed by all visitors. It will show your username, age, height, caste, occupation, city and date of updation. Typically these are the details by which you cannot be identified. However your detailed profile will not be viewable if you choose the second or the third option. In the second case, an unregistered user will be prompted to register in order to view your detailed profile. Whereas in the third case even a registered user will not be able to view your detailed profile if his/her profile does not pass your filter settings. 
<br><br>
However, we would recommend you to go for the second option because the third option might minimize the number of responses your profile can get. 
<br><br>
<b>For Photograph</b><br>
In case you wish to upload your photograph(s) along with your profile then you have the following options :<br>
&#8226; I want my photos to be visible to all members and to be shown in the Member's Photo Club<br>
&#8226; I want my photos to be visible only to members I contact and to members I accept.<br>
&#8226; I want to HIDE my photos temporarily <br><br>

Thus you get to set that privacy level for your photograph which you feel most comfortable with. 
<br><br>
We would however recommend that you do upload your photographs and go in for the first privacy setting option as that is likely to get you the maximum relevant response.<br>
The photograph privacy settings options are available on the photograph upload page. This page can be accessed after you have registered your profile. 
<br><br>
<b>For contacts</b><br>
When entering profile on Jeevansathi you can specify criteria based on which people who do not match your desired partner profile are unable to contact you. Thus you are not bothered by people who you are clear you would not be interested in. 
<br><br>
Filter setting are available once you have entered your desired partner profile.
<br><br>
So when you register with Jeevansathi you register with the most confidential Indian matrimonial site. So register with confidence.<!--DISCRIPTION ENDS-->
