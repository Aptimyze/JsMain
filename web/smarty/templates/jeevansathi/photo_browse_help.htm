 <br>
 It is our new and exclusive value-added feature that makes your
matrimonial search easier, precise, time-saving and interesting too! Now
you can search Photo Profiles by shortlisting profiles based on the
following criteria:

</p>

  <li>AGE: Enter the minimum and the maximum age limit of the kind of
partner you are looking for. This way you can filter out unwanted
profiles and search only the profiles of the members in the age group
you are looking for.</li><br><br>
  <li>CASTE: Go through profiles of people whose caste matches yours. If
caste is not such an important criteria for you, you can skip this
section by clicking the "Go" button.</li><br><br>
  <li>MOTHER TONGUE: Choose the profiles of members who match your mother
tongue or particular region or area that you are looking for.:For e.g:
Punjabi, Bengali etc.</li><br><br>
  <li>COUNTRY: Make your search more specific by looking into the profiles
of residents from only  that particular country where you want to settle
down. For e.g: A long time resident of U.K. would prefer a partner from
the same country and now with photo browse, it&rsquo;s more convenient to find
your dream match without searching the entire globe!.</li><br><br>
  <li>INCOME:  If  Income is a criteria  for your partner search, then you
can choose     the income field you are looking for-for e.g
100000-200000, 200000-300000 and so on
