<br><font color="#b52618"><b>RESPECT</b></font>

<p><font color="#b52618"><b>The flow of your relationship will stimulate mutual respect and, thereby, growth of love.</b></font></p>
<p>In any relationship it is respect that is most important. Love is
said to, "flourish in the soil of mutual respect." When any two people
get together there is a particular flow between them. If it flows well,
both people feel respected, cared for and loved. If it does not flow
well, both people fell disrespected, incompetent and frustrated. Men
and women tend to feel loved for different things and thus need to be
respected in different ways. Men feel most loved when their thoughts
and actions are respected and when they are appreciated for what they
do. Women feel most loved when their feelings are respected and when
they are appreciated for who they are. This is not to say that a woman
does not feel loved when her thoughts and actions are respected and
when she is appreciated for what she does, it is only to say that she
feels most loved when her feelings are respected and when she is
appreciated for who she is. Men do feel loved when they are appreciated
for who they are and when they have their feelings respected, but they
feel most loved when they are respected for their thoughts and actions
and when they are appreciated for what they do. Since men and women
feel most loved when respected for different things, a healthy
relationship will flow in such a way so that both people will most
often be respected for what is most important to them.</p>

<p>Your relationship is set up so that the energy will flow from the
man to the woman, which is the ideal situation. The man will get a
clear picture of what needs to be done in the relationship and he will
be able to take the steps to do it. This will put him in a position
where the woman will have the opportunity to respect him for what he is
doing. As a result he will feel loved and his self-esteem and
confidence will flourish and he will become a better man as a result.
He will also get ideas about the relationship and what to do in the
relationship and bring them to the woman for her consideration and
input so they can work together to create a happy future. The woman
will feel loved and cared for since the man is taking the steps that
show that she is important to him and that she is worth building a life
with. Since the man will be demonstrating his love for the woman, the
woman will feel better and better about herself. Any ills she may have
suffered in the past and in past relationships that have caused her to
wonder why anyone would ever want to be with her will become distant
memories and she will become a better and happier woman.</p>

<p>If for some reason you find things not flowing as smoothly, then
there are likely to be issues that both of you have to work out as
individuals, but which the relationship can help you work out. If
things are not flowing as expected, then the man will be in need of
improving his self-esteem. He probably doubts himself or just doesn't
know what he wants in life. This can cause him to not put the proper
energy into the relationship or make it hard for him to have the
courage to tell the woman what he wants. Given time, this relationship
can help him discover these things about himself, since the flow of the
relationship will help him breed the confidence he needs. The woman
will probably still feel the need to prove herself, that somehow she is
not "good enough," or that if she does not do it, no one will do it
just for her. As a result of feeling these things, she may do a lot
more than necessary in the relationship. Given time, the good flow in
this relationship will help her feel better about these things and help
her experience a whole new world where she is the center of her man's
attention and actions.</p>

<br><font color="#b52618"><b>WAVELENGTH</b></font>

<p><font color="#b52618"><b>You are on Completely Different Wavelengths</b></font></p>
<p>For a relationship to be smooth, efficient and nurturing the couple
has to be on the same wavelength. They must have mutual needs so that
they can share in the fulfillment of those needs and they must have an
innate ability to understand each other. Everything that we do in life
has a subtle influence upon us. Throughout the day we crave one thing
or another. Fulfilling these cravings goes a long way in helping us
feel balanced and energized. When our body is craving exercise we need
to get out there and move or we just won't feel okay. If we are feeling
the need to be by the ocean we won't feel right until we get there. If
we feel like eating a certain food, we will feel hungry until we eat
that food. So it goes throughout the day. A couple that wants to spend
a lot of time together has to have needs and cravings that are similar
in nature and they have to have these needs at the same time.
Otherwise, one or both of the individuals will not experience enough of
what they need and end up not feeling right until, over time, they will
become drained. If this type of attunement is not there, then the
couple will also not relate and communicate well together since they
really won't be tuned into the same thing at the same time.</p>

<p>Your Wavelength score is less than fifteen, which puts you on a
different wavelength. As a result of this, you will not really be
attuned to each other and will often have very different needs. This
can make it difficult and quite an act of compromise to get both of
your needs met. But if you don't, one or both of you will start feeling
off and can even get drained to the point of exhaustion or sickness.
This low Wavelength score shows that you are not really attuned to each
other, which can make it more difficult to understand each other so
communication will have to be much more verbal and very clear. Since
you are on a different wavelength, you won't be able to tune into each
other's needs and words as well and so your sharing won't feel as deep
as you probably would like it to be. Low attunement means that you
actually "vibrate" at a different and even conflicting frequency, so
spending a lot of time with each other in close proximity, sleeping in
the same bed and such can actually be draining. You will probably
notice that if you do sleep together you will need more sleep, so if
you want to keep this relationship, doing more things alone and even
sleeping in different beds occasionally may well be necessary to keep
you both feeling balanced, energized and healthy.</p>

<p>Often a low Wavelength score does not seem like a big problem at the
beginning of a relationship. It is over time that the difficult effects
become apparent. So this may not feel very serious at first, but over
time you may find the relationship draining and find yourselves growing
apart and pursuing more and more things without each other.</p>

<p>If you are involved with a person that you have a low Wavelength
score with and you are trying to work things out, the best thing that
you can do is be independent and allow both of you to go and do what
you need to do for yourself in order to feel balanced and energized.
Then come together and enjoy your time together with energy and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Your Wavelength score is determined by eight different astrological
measures. Each of these eight measures has something important to show
you about your relationship. Continue reading to learn all about these
eight factors and how they are affecting your relationship.</p>

<br><font color="#b52618"><b>EXCESS</b></font>

<p><font color="#b52618"><b>Your Relationship Suffers from Excess Vata</b></font></p>
<p>Each persons physical health as well as their actions are governed
by three principles: Kapha, Pitta and Vata. Kapha correlates to the
Chinese principle of Yin and to the Phlegmatic temperament. Pitta
correlates to the Yang principle and the Bilious temperament. Vata
correlates to the interplay or movement of Yin and Yang and the Windy
temperament. These principles are very important in respect to our
actions, health and feelings. Kapha provides the capacity for love,
devotion, receptivity, rest, enjoyment and emotional response. Pitta
provides courage, initiative, leadership, determination, intelligence,
improvement and protection. Vata provides the capacity for the change
and adjustment that life requires in order to live healthily and
happily. If one of these temperaments becomes excessive, then the
relationship, the lives of both the individuals and the physical health
of the couple may become unbalanced and strained.</p>

<p>Each person has their own make up and blend of Kapha, Pitta and
Vata, which is their "normal" state. This "normal" state may or may not
be a healthy "normal." Regardless of a person's normal mental and
physical state, when we relate to another person, the energy can change
and there is the possibility of two people relating together to create
an excess of Kapha, Pitta or Vata which results in their relationship
having some imbalance. The imbalance will also carry over into the rest
of their lives.</p>

<p>Astrological Factors indicate that your relationship suffers from
excess Vata. Excess Vata can make it difficult to maintain focus and
consistency and you may find your lives together being full of change
and instability. You may especially notice inconsistency with the small
things, such as eating regularly, sleeping regular hours, keeping a
schedule, etc. When trying to work something out, you may find
yourselves quickly becoming confused and unsure of your thoughts and
not be able to explain yourself the way that you desire to. Or, if you
do actually come up with a game plan, you will find it difficult to
follow through. Basically, excess Vata causes the relationship to be a
bit ungrounded and makes it more difficult for you both to be focused
and grounded when in each other's presence. This not only creates
difficulties in small things, like not having a clear idea of how to
proceed or what to do at times, but also with the big thing of what to
do with the relationship. When you do feel a lack of focus around each
other, just a short time apart can get you both on track again.</p>

<p>Ancient astrological texts state that excess Vata will harm the
woman more than the man. Vata is the energy of movement, grace and
change, which is usually more dominant in women than in men. Excess
Vata in a relationship, therefore, tends to affect the woman more than
the man. So it is more likely that the woman will feel that her life is
getting more inconsistent and lacking focus and direction. Excess Vata
can cause the woman to suffer from fatigue, constipation, stress, and
lethargy in the mornings, restlessness in the evenings and shallow or
disturbed sleep. It is, therefore, a good idea to emphasize taking care
of the woman's health and make sure that she eats and sleeps regularly,
gets away from the stress and finds something relaxing to do. Exercise
helps. Excess Vata can, of course, affect the man as well, but usually
it is the woman that suffers the Vata excess the most.</p>

<p>Excess Vata reduces your Wavelength score by eight points over what
it would be if you did not have any such excess. Lack of focus and
spaciness can prevent you from projecting yourselves the way that you
really are; therefore, it becomes difficult to relate to each other as
you really are with your true intentions. Thus, you will not be as
attuned to each other and will more often feel out of sorts with each
other's goals and ambitions.</p>


<p><i>Having this excess is likely to be the biggest obstacle to having
the perfect relationship, so you will want to concentrate on working
this out.</i></p>

<p>Astrological indications reveal that you will find it quite easy,
and even automatic to be constructive with each other. You will find
many things to create together and share many desires together that you
hope to build into your lives. You will very often desire to do and
create very similar things so that there will be many opportunities to

with many emotional depths and that the man has a progressive,
industrious and practical temperament. These are not compatible
temperaments and so you lose up to six points that you could have

<p>Women with this type of astrological lunar temperament are very
temperamental and their unbridled emotions can make them go to extremes
at times. Only men with the same type of astrological temperament are

temperaments, such as the man in question, will have a hard time
appreciating this type of woman. He will misunderstand her and often
feel threatened by her, and she will not feel accepted for who she is.
Nor will he have the ability to settle her at times when she is feeling
an extremely turbulent or depressing emotion, or to help her feel
better when she is down in the dumps.</p>

enmity either. Compromise will be more necessary, but it shouldn't be
any great problem to come to decisions that leave you both feeling
happy. When things get tough, you may find yourself holding back a bit
so as not to say anything that you may regret and it may be tough to
work things out when they get hard, but you will be able to in the end.
Since you do not have an ill affinity towards each other, you earn a

<br><font color="#b52618"><b>INSTINCTIVE COMPATIBILITY</b></font>

<p>Each person has an instinctive nature that they rely upon in intense
situations when all recourse has left them. This instinctive nature is
usually resorted to in crisis situations and in situations when a
person has to do something, but does not know what to do. The
instinctive nature also comes out to a lesser degree during the more
intense aspects of sex. For a couple to go through intense situations
harmoniously together and for a couple to bond through intense
experiences and sexual experiences, it is important that their
instinctive natures be compatible.</p>

<p>Astrological indications reveal that your instinctive natures are
harmoniously disposed towards each other, which is great and earns you
three out of a possible four points towards your total Wavelength
score. Having harmonious instinctive natures will help you get through
the intense experiences in life together and you will even bond through
these experiences.</p>

<br><font color="#b52618"><b>COMFORT</b></font>

<p>A man's temperament will either feel comfortable and safe to a
women, or it will feel more threatening. If the man's temperament feels
safe and comfortable, then the woman will, or course, feel better about
the relationship, and she will also be better able to get over any
issues that may be making having a good relationship difficult for her.
It will help her grow emotionally. The man will also benefit as he will
fell like he is doing the right things in the relationship which will
help him fell good about himself and, by extension, the relationship.
If, on the other hand, the man's temperament feels more threatening,
the woman will only have a more difficult time feeling secure in the
relationship and the efforts that the man might make to move the
relationship forward, or to improve the relationship, may actually
cause a setback in the relationship. If that is the case, the man may
become frustrated and unhappy with himself and, by extension, the
relationship.</p>

<p>Astrological indications reveal that the man's general temperament
is non-threatening to the woman and so you gain three points towards
your total Wavelength score. This will help both of you feel good about
the relationship - the woman will feel good because more of the man's
actions (if indeed he takes any actions) will feel right by her and the
man will feel good because he is doing right by the woman. In times of
difficulty, there is a greater possibility of working things out, what
the man will do to fix the problem (if he attempts to fix the problem)
will more often than not be what will fix the problem.</p>

<p>This is quite a minor comparison by itself, and by itself it will
not have a major say in the relationship, it is only important in the
context of gaining a high enough Wavelength score as to have a good
relationship.</p>

<p>Astrological indications reveal that your relationship is more

<p><font color="#b52618"><b>Obstacles can be overcome so that you can be together.</b></font></p>
<p>In any relationship so much has to happen for two people to
completely be together. Many of these things are practical things, like
living in the same place, both being free and unattached, having work
schedules that allow the necessary time for being together and having
enough money to feel secure about building a life together. Then there
is always the matter of being in the same mood and frame of mind so
that they can enjoy sharing their lives with each other. Getting all of
these things to fall into place can be quite a chore at times and there
is plenty of opportunity for setbacks and obstacles to being together.
For some couples, their destinies are timed so completely differently
that there will always be something, or some feeling, preventing them
from fully being together. Their destinies pull them apart and simply
living their very lives becomes a source of obstacles to being
together. When one lives in California, the other lives in Florida,
when the Californian moves to Florida, the Floridian moves to New York
to take care of their mother...and so the relationship goes or, rather,
does not go. Fortunately, you escape this and the timing of your
destinies is not an impossible conflict. So long as other compatibility
factors are okay, you will be able to sort out your lives and make any
changes and adjustments necessary in order to be together.</p>

<p><font color="#b52618"><b>Your association does not bring any extra misfortune into your lives.</b></font></p>
<p>Besides the obvious importance to love and to be loved in a
relationship, it is important for every couple to share a productive
and happy life together. In fact, being in love increases our desire to
live a productive and fortunate life. Some people get together and find
their lives getting better and find more and more meaning to be with
each other. Others, on the other hand, get together only to have
everything go completely wrong, not just wrong in their lives, but
wrong between them as well. Their very togetherness brings ill feelings
between them along with misfortune. It is as if they are tied to a
string of unfortunate events. Fortunately, one astrological measurement
will show whether a couple is tied to the type of misfortune that has
no end and no cure or if their association does not breed any extra ill
into their lives.</p>

<p>Astrological indications reveal that your relationship does not
suffer from any such type of unfortunate attachments. Due to your own
inherent destinies and personalities you may still find yourselves
attracting unfortunate events, in which case you will need to take a
close look at yourselves as individuals so that you can see what issues
you are holding onto that are attracting the ill events. You may also
find yourselves playing games with each other or putting walls up
between each other. If that is the case, it points to issues that you
need to work out and not issues that are the result of your association
with each other.</p>

<p>While the Moon represents a person's nature and consciousness, Mars
is the planet through which we assert what is in our mind and heart.
For two people to have a harmonious relationship, not only must they
have an innate attunement towards each other, they must also assert
themselves equally, or else the relationship will become imbalanced and
frustrated. The position of Mars in your horoscope, and not just in one
of your Vedic charts but in three important charts, determines how much
force you assert yourself with in your relationship. If both of you
assert yourselves with relatively equal force, you will be able to work
together to have a balanced and healthy relationship. If one of you
asserts yourself more than the other, then the relationship will become
imbalanced.</p>

<p>Your horoscopes show that you assert yourselves with relatively
equal pressure. This will help you to act and respond towards each
other in a balanced fashion that allows both of you to feel like you
have a say in your relationship, that the relationship is equal and
that both of your needs are getting met. You are equally matched in
strength and you can, therefore, work together to build a better life.</p>

<br><font color="#b52618"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font>

<p>Relationships are rarely easy as we all bring our challenging
personalities into our relationships. When it comes down to it, the
right relationship is the relationship that we feel right about being
in the way that it is. A relationship in which we love a person but
hope for things to be different and to change, cannot really be termed
the right relationship. It is natural for each of us to have our hopes
and wishes and no relationship will fulfill them all, but if we can
accept the relationship for the hopes that it does fulfill then we are
on the right track to the right relationship. Further, if the hopes
that the relationship does not fulfill do not become a source of damage
to the relationship or do not cause us to be cruel to our partner, then
it is the right relationship.</p>

<p>The Vedic compatibility focuses on this right type of relationship.
The considerations it makes are those that determine if people can have
this type of foundation together. Since the five important measurements
between you two are all good or acceptable, the foundation for this
type of relationship is there. If you are still having problems in the
relationship even though these five important measurements are okay,
then you have to look towards yourself, as that will be the source of
the problems and you will have to work those out before you will ever
have the right kind of relationship.</p>

<p>The five important measurements are Respect, Wavelength, Obstacles,
Misfortune and Assertive Pressure. Since all of these are harmonious,
or if they are inharmonious they are balanced by something else as
mentioned above, this relationship can provide for the healthy growth
of you both, it helps to bring out your best and it helps you to work
through your issues so that you can live a happier and more productive
life.</p>
