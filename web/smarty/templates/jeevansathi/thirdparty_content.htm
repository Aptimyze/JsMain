<b>Express disclaimers for Predictive Third Party Content</b>
<br><br>
www.jeevansathi.com carries active links to another website “matchastro.com”, which in turn provides predictive content. However, the said predictive content is not being generated by www.jeevansathi.com in-house but has been outsourced to another entity and such outsourced content is being delivered through the channel of www.jeevansathi.com. 
<br><br>
An astrological prediction is just an opinion of the astrologer and has no scientific authenticity. These predictions are based upon the characteristics, placements, aspects, associations, strengths, weaknesses of the planets and the ability, grip over the subject and experience of the astrologer in Vedic astrology. 
<br><br>
A Vedic astrological horoscope is the opinion of one person based on his or her training and experience in the subject. On receiving a particular enquiry from a client, this query is passed to a panel of astrologers for the predictions/remedies and answered within 7 working days or earlier. Generally 2-3 astrologers give their predictions for an enquiry. Another astrologer's opinion on any particular point might differ. Recommendation for astrological remedies such as gemstones, mantras, yantras etc. are often prescribed by astrologers, after a diligent study of the client's birth chart and with due exercise of his prudence and judgment. All Predictions are made based on Horoscope prepared on Birth Database provided by the Client in accordance to the principals of Vedic Astrology. 
<br><br>
Though all the predictions are provided by a panel of eminent astrologers, the same should not be used as a substitute to an advice of a licensed professional, medical / psychiatric treatment, study, a curriculum, profession or life style or treatment that you would normally receive from a licensed professional, such as a lawyer, doctor, psychiatrist, or financial advisor. The predictions, opinions and remedial measures of two astrologers on one horoscope may differ and have varied results. It must be clearly understood that every such prescription is accompanied by a prescribed method and procedure, which is expected to be followed by our clients with due diligence. Info Edge (India) Limited is not responsible for any claims for negative functioning of any prescription of astrological remedy made by any of astrologers working for matchastro.com.
