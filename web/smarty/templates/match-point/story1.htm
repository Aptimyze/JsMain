                                                <p>Marriages are made in heaven and consummated on earth. Jeevansathi.com math point made things better for both of us as this is not our first marriage and we had passed through a very sad phase in our respective lives. What we had lost in our past is a different story but what we got through Jeevansathi.com is like a dream come true for both of us. On 20th May 2008, I got registered on Jeevansathi.com Match Point. I can’t forget the special attention given to us in finding a compatible match as I had some issues and also for Akshay (who was also searching for better half via Jeevansathi.com) but eventually things turned positive and finally we got married on 12th December 2008.</p>
