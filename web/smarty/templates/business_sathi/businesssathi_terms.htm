To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and commission fee accrual, we will provide you with special "tagged" link formats to be used in all banner links between your Website and our Website. It must be ensured that each of the links between your Website and our Website properly utilises the tagged link format only. You will earn the commission fee only when activity on our Website occurs directly through the Special tagged Links (The term Special tagged Links means a link which contains your affiliate id in the URL): we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you to use Special Links, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts which would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You will, however, earn commission fees with respect to all Free and Paid Memberships on our Website occurring through the above mentioned "tagged" link. <br>
