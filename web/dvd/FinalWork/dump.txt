    [16] => I am working professional looking for a loving caring and affectionate partner. For me life is not just living together but sharing a relationship and understanding each other. I am looking for a partner who shares the same grounds like me and believe in starting a life with a meaning. I am sure to take my partner on a joy ride of coming life with transparency throughout and zest to live life kingsize. So, if you think there is more to life than broken marriages and relationships do repond to this.  What I&amp;#039;m looking for: Honestly speaking - I don&amp;#039;t think that I&amp;#039;ve got everything laid out in my mind. Some fundamental characterisitics which I think have to be there --I should be attracted to him, he should be smart, educated, compatible. And most importantly, I should be able to see the spark of love when I see him! I&amp;#039;m very family oriented and relationships mean a lot to me. For me commitment and loyalty are two very important ingredients of a successful relationship. I see my soul mate as an extension of myself and myself as an extension of him. So, if you are Handsome, charming, well educated, well bred, intellectually stimulating,  drop me a line and we&amp;#039;ll take it from there !      As far as my Divorce is concerned, I got married at the age of 18 and have a boy child from that marriage. However, he is legally with his father and I have no contact with him since 5yrs. Hence,for me its the Reincarnation.

She knows driving, is a good cook and an efficient manager of house-hold affairs.  Her hobbies include cooking, reading and listening to good music.  Summati is totally blemishless, in so far as her present status as  a divorcee (issueless) is concerned. (Divorce proceedings in her case have been formally  completed already).

As for my career - I am working as an HR professional with an MNC in Bangalore.   My idea on marriage - I believe marriage is an institution where the two families get together and not just the two individuals, who are responsible in bringing these different families together. Marriage as an institution is about adjustments and not compromises.   About my idea of desired partner: I am looking for honesty, depth and equality in all respects. A sincere person with right values. One who does not dominate &amp;amp; is not selfish but respects the views of others. Someone who is sensitive, independent, confident, trustworthy with a good sense of humor.

An ideal friend with whom she can share and grow with, to take on the challenges of life.

She is a registered medical practitioner and has recently completed her N.D. in Alternative Medicines-Naturopathy wherein she underwent training in courses such as clinical nutrition, wheat grass therapy, magnet therapy, acupuncture, homoeopathic medicine, botanical medicine psychology and counseling.  She also has taken computer courses in MS Office.  She is planning on starting her own naturopathy clinic.  Appearance:  Vanita has a very pleasant personality.  She is extremely good looking with sharp features.  She is extremely health conscious and maintains clean health habits.  Full of life, she is very active - be it helping her mother in house chores or lending a hand in other affairs.  At the age of 7 she had an attack of leuocoderma (white patches on the skin) and as a result, the whole body color has become uniformly fair and it looks quite natural.  Interests and Personality :  My daughter is an eternal optimist with zest for life.  A unique person with multi-dimensional personality, she is witty, upbeat, enthusiastic and energetic.  She inspires life.  Perhaps her main strength is her unflinching faith in God, which makes her an extremely down to earth, honest and caring person. She has immense respect for elders and is a person with a heart of gold. One who nurtures relationships with a warm and caring attitude. One who values the opportunity to provide care and support to children with unfortunate backgrounds.  She has been an active volunteer with a social non-profit organization &amp;#039;Child Relief And You&amp;#039; and has also served as a volunteer at Spastics Society of India.  I can go on with the list but among her other varied interests she loves to cook, listen to soft music and even contribute articles related to herbal cures and therapeutic exercises.
